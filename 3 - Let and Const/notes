1 - Defining Variables in JS 
  var message = "Hello";
  const pi = 3.14;
  let score = 0;

2 - Creating Unchanging Variables with Const
  Using const : We dont expect to change this guy after initializing it
  Example: pi is a constant and will not be changed so it should be a const
  But score is constantly updated in the program for example so we dont want to use it as const

3 - Using Constants and Arrays with Objects
  We've said earlier that we cant modify const once it is initialized
  But when we do something like:
  const days = ['mon', 'tue']
  We still can change 'days' by push, pop, reassign values ...
  Like: days['mon'] = 'Monday'
        days.push('Wednesday')
        days.pop()
  Except we dont reassign totally 'days' for a new array like: days = ['Thursday','Friday'];
  It will be fine. So what happened here? Actually we dont change 'days' const
  'days' just keep a reference to our actual array (means 'days' points to actual object)
  And here we changed object, we did not change 'days' which is constant
  When we totally reassign 'days' to a new array, it causes an error because
  we are pointing days to somewhere else
  
  The same concept for 'object'

4 - Defining a Variable with Let
  In a lot of cases, 'let' seems to works similar as 'var'?

5 - Using Let with For Loops
